### Abstract

With the development of the new generation of sequencing platforms and the development of metagenomics and metatranscriptomics technologies, complex microorganism communities can be more easily studied. Numerous bioinformatics tools are available for such purpose but analyses of microbiota data remain difficult: numerous different bioinformatics tools must be combined to extract useful information. Indeed, modular, accessible and sharable user-friendly tools are then urgently needed to conduct efficient analyses to explore microbiota data. We developed then ASaiM, an open-source Galaxy-based framework dedicated to microbiota data analyses.

ASaiM provides an expertly selected collection of tools to exploit and visualize taxonomic and functional information from raw amplicon, metagenomic or metatranscriptomic sequences. To help the analyses, several (customizable) workflows are included. The main workflow has been tested on two mock metagenomic datasets with controlled communities. More accurate and precise taxonomic analyses and more informative metabolic description have been obtained compared to EBI metagenomics' pipeline on the same datasets.

The available workflows are supported by tutorials and Galaxy interactive tours to guide the users through the analyses. Furthermore, an effort on documentation of ASaiM, its tools and workflows has been made (http://asaim.readthedocs.io/).

Based on the Galaxy framework, ASaiM offers sophisticated analyses to scientists without command-line knowledge, while emphasizing reproducibility, customization and effortless scale up to larger infrastructures. ASaiM is implemented as Galaxy Docker flavour and can be easily extended with additional tools or workflows. ASaiM provides then a powerful framework to easily and quickly exploit microbiota data in a reproducible and transparent environment.
