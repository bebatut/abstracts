### Abstract

With the advent of high-throughput data analysis in life sciences has become tightly linked with the use of computational tools, resources, and high-performance computing infrastructure. However, the scientists who generate the data often do not possess the knowledge required to take the full advantage of these developments. Here we describe a community-based approach to develop open, collaborative, and scalable training resources designed to enable experimental biologists to perform sophisticated large scale analyses. In particular, the Galaxy Training Network (http://galaxyproject.github.io/training-material) framework is addressing this problem by offering a web-based, intuitive and accessible user interface to numerous bioinformatics tools.

Currently we provide tutorials in twelve topics ranging from quality control of sequencing data to complex subjects such as transcriptomics or analysis of DNA/protein interactions. These are offered as hands-on tutorials, slides, and interactive tours. The tours are a new way to go through a complete analysis inside the Galaxy interface in an interactive and explorative way. All material is openly reviewed, and iteratively developed in one central repository by 40 contributors. Content is written in Markdown and the model separates presentation from content. In addition, the technological infrastructure needed to teach each topic is described with a list of needed tools. The data (citable via DOI) required for the hands-on, time and resource estimations and flavored Galaxy Docker images are also provided.

This material is automatically propagated to Elixir’s TeSS portal. With this community effort, the GTN offers an open, collaborative, FAIR and up-to-date infrastructure for delivering high-quality bioinformatics training for scientists.
